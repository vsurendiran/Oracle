SYSDATE: Returns the current date and time of the database server.
CURRENT_DATE: Returns the current date and time in the session's time zone.

The most commonly used SQL aggregate functions are:
========================================================
MIN() - returns the smallest value within the selected column
MAX() - returns the largest value within the selected column
COUNT() - returns the number of rows in a set
SUM() - returns the total sum of a numerical column
AVG() - returns the average value of a numerical column
Aggregate functions ignore null values (except for COUNT()).

  select level l from dual connect by level<=100
),

and l1.l>1
)

minus select l from unprime;


2. select l prime_number
      from (select level l from dual connect by level <= 100)

     where m<=l
     group by l
    having count(case l/m when trunc(l/m) then 'Y' end) = 2
     order by l
  
3. select listagg(prime_number,'&') within group (order by prime_number) from
(select l prime_number
from

order by l);
