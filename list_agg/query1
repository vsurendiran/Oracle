--- In 11g maximum number of character is 4000. If it is more it will throw error result of concatenation is too long

--- In 12C we have listagg_overflow_clause to display the count of truncated value
select length(listagg(ename,',' on overflow truncate 'Some more name exists' without count) within group (order by ename))

--- No need to use " within group (order by ename) " in 18c onwards
select deptno, listagg(ename,',')  from emp group by deptno;
--- We can use distinct in 19c
select deptno, listagg(distinct job,',') from emp group by deptno;
